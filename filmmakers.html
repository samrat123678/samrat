        <p5> Rashaad Newsome (Director) is a NYC-based multidisciplinary artist whose work blends several practices—including collage, sculpture, film, music, computer programming, and performance—to form an altogether new field. Using the diasporic tradition of improvisation, he crafts compositions that speak of and to Black and Queer culture and walk the tightrope between intersectionality, social practice and abstraction. Newsome was born in New Orleans and received a BFA in Art History from Tulane University. He has exhibited and performed in museums, institutions, and festivals internationally including The Studio Museum in Harlem, The National Museum of African American History and Culture, The Whitney Museum, and the Centre Georges Pompidou. Newsome has created 12 films which have been acquired by numerous institutions including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and SFMOMA. His many honors include a 2019 LACMA Art and Technology Grant, a 2019 BAVC MediaMaker Fellowship, and a 2018 William Penn Foundation Grant. </p5>
